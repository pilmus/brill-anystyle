               </hi>
            </head>
            <p>Intercultural pragmatics has emerged as a relatively new area of linguistic research, building on earlier work in cross-cultural pragmatics. Pragmatics examines how language is used and interpreted in context, and cross-cultural pragmatics analyzes differences across languages and cultures in these respects. Intercultural pragmatics, on the other hand, focuses on the interaction between people from different cultural backgrounds, so whereas cross-cultural pragmatics is comparative in orientation, intercultural pragmatics examines the dynamics of language use and (mis)interpretation, as the interlocutors interact with each other. What, though, is meant by “different cultural backgrounds”? Many authors (Cheng and Warren 2001; Rogerson-Revell 2007; Bailey 2000; Spencer-Oatey and Xing 2003; Gumperz and Roberts 1991; Gudykunst and Mody 2002; Bilbow 2002) treat interaction between members of different language or ethnic groups as automatically intercultural and label them as such. Yet if culture is associated with membership of any type of social group (i.e., not only national, linguistic and/or ethnic, but also other types such as professional or religious), virtually all communication can be regarded as intercultural, especially since people simultaneously belong to multiple different cultural groups. As a result, some would regard this interpretation as too all-encompassing, also because culture does not necessarily impact on the communication process at all times. Žegarac (2007:41), for example, takes a cognitive pragmatic perspective to distinguish between intracultural and intercultural communication, and identifies an intercultural situation as one in which “the cultural distance between the participants is significant enough to have an adverse effect on communicative success, unless it is appropriately accommodated by the participants”. In this lemma we include both interpretations, and report on research into Chinese–non-Chinese interaction, especially in English, that may or may not report culture as having an effect.</p>

            </head>
            <p>A number of factors influence how well participants of an intercultural interaction understand each other’s messages. Clearly, one of the most fundamental of these is use of the linguistic code because, if people cannot speak a given language fluently, and/or if proficient speakers use it in “unhelpful” ways, it will be very difficult for them to understand each other. However, even when there are no problems of this kind, achieving understanding can still be extremely difficult because it is never feasible for everything to be conveyed explicitly in the code. Much has to be left for the interlocutors to work out, drawing on their background knowledge, including their pragmatic knowledge – the conventions and principles that underlie language use in a given sociocultural group. As a result of different pragmatic knowledge, combined with possible pragmatic transfer (Žegarac and Pennington 2008; Kirkpatrick and Xu 2002), people may focus on different clues when inferring meanings, and/or they may arrive at different meanings from the same clues. Mismatches may thus occur in the messages that people think have been communicated.</p>
            <p>A number of studies (Bilbow 2002; Li 1999; Cheng 2003a; Cheng and Warren 2001; Du-Babcock and Babcock 1996; Fung 2007; Ewington <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> 2009; Spencer-Oatey and Xing 2005; Stadler and Spencer-Oatey 2009; Young 1994; Yeung 2000; Ulijn and Li 1995) have examined how language is used in intercultural interactions to achieve mutual understanding. Elements focused on include the use of commissive speech acts, level of language proficiency, the use of vague language, strategies for checking understanding, the use of self-repetition, speed of speech, information structuring, and stylistic choice. Some studies have found that culture has little impact on language use and mutual understanding; for example, Cheng and Warren (2001) report that Hong Kong Chinese and English native speakers employ vague language in very similar ways in their interactions with each other, and achieve successful and cooperative communication.</p>
            <p>This can be illustrated by the following two excerpts. In the first, the non-native speakers of English, probably not knowing the term in English, resort to vague language (Cheng and Warren 2001:91; bold original): </p>
            <p>      b: what kind of peanuts are you planning to bring</p>
            <p>      a: <hi rendition="#bold">kind of traditional thing</hi>
            </p>
            <p>      b: traditional  </p>
            <p>In the second, the native speaker, accomodating the non-native speaker’s linguistic competence, resorts to vague language too (from Cheng and Warren 2001:94; bold original).</p>
            <p>      a: yea well all my life in Thailand they don’t eat that much you know</p>
            <p>          what I mean is <hi rendition="#bold">the food is light</hi> (.) you have <hi rendition="#bold">rice and vegetables</hi>
            </p>
            <p>          <hi rendition="#bold">and soups things like that</hi> and then all of a sudden</p>
            <p>Other studies have found some noticeable differences. For instance, Young (1994) reports differences in preferred information sequencing that can impact on understanding, and Ewington <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> (2009) describe how differences in British and Chinese preferences for formality of interaction influenced the negotiations and planning of a joint workshop.</p>
            <p>Du-Babcock and Babcock (1996) examined the use of Chinese by expatriate staff working for multinationals in Táiwān, and explored the impact that level of competence had on communication processes and effectiveness. They found that proficiency was a two-edged sword:</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>      ...expatriate second language competence almost always aided effective communication if confined to social situations for speaking and listening and in business situations for listening. Expansion of the use of Chinese to business situations carried with it the potential of improved communication but also the potential pitfall of miscommunication and cultural alienation. (Du-Babcock and D.Babcock 1996:159–160)     </item>

            </head>
            <p>An important focus of much pragmatics research is the role of language in the management of interpersonal relations, and here issues such as politeness, face, and rapport are explored. Early research in the intercultural field took a cross-cultural approach, with comparative studies of speech acts being particularly common (e.g., Bilbow 1995; Chen 1993; Clancy <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> 1996; Jiang 2006; Loh 1993; Spencer-Oatey <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> 2000; Tang and Zhang 2009; Yeung 2000). Various differences were reported; for example, Chen (1993), Spencer-Oatey <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> (2000/2008) and Tang and Zhang (2009) compared the responses to compliments of Chinese and English speakers (American, British, and Australian respectively) and found that their Chinese respondents consistently used fewer “accept” strategies and more “evade” and “reject” strategies than their English-speaking counterparts. From an intercultural pragmatic perspective, this raises the question as to whether such normative differences affect the ways in which relational management is handled and interpreted in intercultural interactions. Spencer-Oatey <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> (2000/2008) found that British and Chinese respondents evaluated “reject” responses significantly differently, with the Chinese associating them with modesty and with the British having difficulty understanding why they had been used. Similarly, Chang and Haugh (2011), in a study of an apology between an Australian and a Taiwanese, report that Australians and Taiwanese informants who evaluated the authentic apology in a follow-up study, displayed significant differences in their ratings of the degree of (im)politeness of the apology. Chang and Haugh (2011:434) also report another important finding: that evaluations of (im)politeness are not necessarily centered on individual utterances but may arise from discourse-based impressions. This finding reflects the more recent trend towards the analysis of intercultural discourse, rather than the study of (often) de-contextualized speech acts. Issues that have been investigated in this way include negotiation styles (e.g., Ladegaard 2011; Li <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> 2001; Zhu 2011), small talk (e.g., Ladegaard 2011; Li <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> 2001; Spencer-Oatey and Xing 1998), humor (Rogerson-Revell 2007; Cheng 2003b), impression management (Bilbow 1997), and face and rapport (Spencer-Oatey and Xing 2000/2008, 2003, 2004).</p>
            <p>Li <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> (2001), for example, analyzed the last five minutes of a business negotiation meeting between a British businessman and three Chinese businessmen. They found that the Chinese businessmen used a high involvement style and paid great attention to non-task relationship creation through small talk before getting down to business. The British businessman commented that despite being familiar with “the blurring between business and non-business matters”, he still had problems with it:</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>      Everything seems to take a long time. I’m used to that now, but I’m still having a little trouble with what we’ve agreed, or not agreed for that matter. They talk a lot, about nothing really. At the end of the day, I want to go home and tell my colleagues, yes we have a deal. (Li <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> 2001:144)     </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Spencer-Oatey and Xing (2000/2008, 2003, 2004) report even greater problems in a business meeting, when British hosts failed to offer their Chinese visitors the opportunity to give a return speech during a welcome meeting. The Chinese interpreted it extremely negatively, with the head of the delegation commenting as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>      According to our home customs and protocol, speech is delivered on the basis of reciprocity. He has made his speech and I am expected to say something. … Condescension was implied. In fact I was reluctant to speak, and I had nothing to say. But I had to, to say a few words. Right for the occasion, right? But he had finished his speech, and he didn’t give me the opportunity, and they each introduced themselves, wasn’t this clearly implied that they do look down upon us Chinese. (Spencer-Oatey and Xing 2008:263)     </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Yet as far as the British chairman was concerned, he thought everyone would prefer the meeting to remain informal.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Some scholars (e.g., Chen 2010; Leech 2007) claim that there is no “East-West divide” in pragmatics, while others (e.g., Gu 1990; Mao 1994; Kirkpatrick and Xu 2002; Zhu <hi rendition="#italic">et al.</hi> 2000; Kasper 1995) hold the view that Chinese pragmatics is very different from Euro-American pragmatics. In fact, there is still a comparative dearth of pragmatic studies of authentic intercultural interaction, especially ones that analyze not only the discourse but also the perspectives and interpretations of the participants themselves. Much more research of this kind is needed, along with appropriate theorizing, if we are to resolve this debate convincingly.</p>

            <head>1. Developments through 1949</head>
            <p>Until the beginning of the 19th century, China's foreign trade was in the hands of Chinese merchants and officials and their trading partners from Asia, increasingly also from Europe. Data on the volume and structure of foreign trade from that era is sparse. It was certainly not free trade in the narrower sense of the term. Foreign trade was viewed much more as a form of the tribute trade (<ref target="COM-00141">tributary system</ref>) and lay under government control. All the same, people appear to have paid heed to market opportunities. For example, export goods like <ref target="SIM-00214">silk</ref> and porcelain (<ref target="SIM-00119">ceramics</ref>), which were favored overseas and hence could be sold for a higher price, took up a greater share of China's exports. This gradually led to a relatively advantageous trade integration of the entire East and Southeast Asian region.</p>
            <p>The sectoral and regional variety in trade was drastically reduced when the European powers divided East and Southeast Asia into spheres of influence at the beginning of the 19th century and bound "their" respective regions to them. Not only were bilateral trade structures established, which served unilateral interests, even the customary interregional Asian trade was eliminated, since it represented trade among different spheres of influence. At the beginning of the 19th century, opium grown in India acquired increasing importance. In the hands of British merchants trading in China, opium was increasingly used as a medium of exchange in place of silver (<ref target="SIM-00179">Opium Wars</ref>); estimates for 1830 place the share of opium imports at about 60% of total imports. Not only did British trading houses benefit from the opium trade, so did Chinese merchants as well as certain groups within the bureaucracy. Opium trade was a shared interest created by British dominance that significantly impacted the structure and scope of foreign trade and which in the Guangdong region was called the "Canton system". Noteworthy changes to import structures followed in the late 19th century, as China increasingly imported cotton textiles as well as kerosene for lighting. Among China's exports, <ref target="SIM-00239">tea</ref> and silk originally dominated, with a share of about 90% in 1868. By the end of the 19th century, exports had broadened and cotton, vegetable oils, pig bristles, skins, furs, etc. were also sold on the world market. At the same time, however, China was hardly in a position to manufacture any more refined products.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, in order to strengthen mobilizing industrialization efforts, industrial raw materials were imported, as were equipment and machines, especially textile machines. Meanwhile, China exported textiles and certain mining products in significantly greater quantity than before. Nonetheless, even then China was still generally confronted with a trade deficit that at times amounted to more than half of its exports. This deficit was financed at first with metal-based currency and then increasingly through foreign credit. In the 1930s, China's foreign trade stagnated as a result of the global depression, and the chaos of war later prevented a quick recovery.</p>

         <div>
            <head>2. Developments 1949-1978</head>
            <p>After the establishment of the People's Republic, CCP cadres came to power, who used foreign trade to serve development policy goals. The prerequisite for the fact that politics and the state made foreign trade decisions rather than merchants' private economic calculations was brought about by the creation of a special foreign trade bureaucracy (<ref target="COM-00010">foreign economic policy</ref>). China's import structures soon changed fundamentally. Imports were to serve <ref target="COM-00064">industrialization</ref> first and foremost. Accordingly, machines, equipment, chemicals, metals, and minerals composed the lion's share of imports. Foreign luxury goods were not to be imported, although basic foodstuffs could be in order to ensure sustenance for the populace, especially in the coastal cities. Due to China's underdeveloped transport infrastructure, it was easier to supply the coastal cities through deliveries from overseas than from the interior. For a long time, exports remained overwhelmingly products of primary industries with low added value, because China did not have the capacity in the short term to transform production and broaden the spectrum of goods destined for the world market.</p>
            <p>It may be assumed that in principle China was interested in a broad, regional diversification of its foreign trade in order to avoid dependence on powerful foreign trade partners. This turned out to be impossible, however, because the US trade embargo prevented Western businesses from intensifying their trade contacts with China. Only the Soviet Union and other command-economy countries supported China's socialist development and supplied industrial equipment among other things. Because of the difficulties involved in converting Rubles and Yuan into Western currencies, it is hard to quantify the trade flow between China and the Soviet bloc in a Western currency. Only estimates exist, for example, placing the Soviet-Chinese trade between 1950 and 1959 at about $2 billion. A portion of the imports at that time were financed through credit - estimated at $1.4 billion between 1950 and 1959 - the repayment of which was primarily accomplished through the delivery of raw materials and agricultural products. Based on the experience of the 18th and 19th centuries, however, China avoided foreign trade deficits, which all to often were bound with dependence on foreign trade partners. The Chinese thought it was possible, however, to politically and economically justify raising investments beyond the then still relatively low domestic savings rate through debt to the ideological like-minded command-economy countries.</p>
            <p>It is scarcely possible to make statements regarding the advantages and disadvantages to China that grew out of the trade with the Soviet bloc at that time, because of the arbitrary nature of the prices set for the exchanged goods. It is nevertheless incontrovertible that through this trade China was put in a position to develop the heavy industry sector so important to the further industrialization of the country. The average yearly growth rate of China's heavy industry between 1952 and 1959 was about 25%. China gained distant access to relatively modern technologies and received practical instruction in the organization of complex work processes. In this way, increases in production and productivity were unleashed that can be equated with the "big push" effect described by development theory.</p>
            <p>By the time party cadres pressed specialists in economic administration and big business into the service of the <ref target="SIM-00084">Great Leap Forward</ref> policy, the Soviet Union was no longer willing to support China's economic development. In addition, differences of opinion over fundamental ideological questions soon contributed to a drastic reduction of bilateral economic relations. In 1962, for example, the trade volume of the two countries was only about $200 million. The risks accompanying foreign debt became painfully clear. To minimize these risks, debts were paid with deliveries of goods, despite catastrophic harvest failure in the early 1960s. Under such conditions the import of equipment and machines was hardly possible.</p>
            <p>In the following years, China's economy consolidated. Export revenues were increasingly attained. Henceforth the emphasis was on aligning imports with foreign exchange revenues and at the same time constructing the broadest possible foreign trade relations at the regional level. Primarily equipment was imported, although no longer mainly for heavy industry, as in the 1950s, but rather for the fertilizer and petrochemical industries. The impending economic dynamic, however, was interrupted by the <ref target="COM-00076">Cultural Revolution</ref>.</p>
            <p>After the Cultural Revolution, economic development was once again placed at the center of political efforts. This was accompanied by an expansion of imports. Agricultural products such as rice, soybeans, fruits, meat, raw animal products, silk, natural fibers, tea, tobacco, and so forth continued to predominate among exports, with a share of about one third of the total exports in 1978. During the same period, exports of textiles and clothing contributed to about a quarter of China's export revenues. Early on such imports already comprised a relatively stable component of Chinese exports and suppressed strong swings in foreign exchange revenues, which would otherwise have appeared during crisis years as a result of poor agricultural returns. Other noteworthy export revenues were produced by the fuel sector, especially the petroleum industry, which accounted for about a tenth of the foreign exchange revenue at the end of the 1970s. Thanks to rising foreign exchange revenues, the import of modern equipment and facilities gained importance once again. In addition, imports of rolled-steel products and nonferrous metals braced China's industrialization. In 1978, these metals accounted for nearly a quarter of the value of all imports. The import of agricultural products like wheat, sugar, oleaginous crops, cotton, etc. sank proportionately. Their share of imports, which during crisis years was extraordinarily high - in the early 1960s for example it was about 50% - fell to about 20%.</p>

            <head>3. Developments since 1978</head>
            <p>In the course of the reforms introduced since 1978, businesses first gained greater autonomy in the domestic economy. Later, the Chinese abandoned enforcing the state monopoly on foreign trade and foreign exchange. The authority to make decisions regarding the import and export of goods and services as well as capital was increasingly delegated, initially to entrepreneurially structured organizations with regional administrative units and later to individual firms as well. Moreover, two formerly authoritative principles of foreign trade policy were abandoned. Previously, import volumes had been matched to the respective foreign exchange revenue earned through exports. The import of modern equipment and facilities was accordingly always limited, on the one hand by the given foreign exchange revenue and on the other by the minimum import volume required for economically essential foreign exchange rates. Hence increases in production and especially advances in productivity depended heavily on highly erratic export revenues. In order to uncouple imports in general and equipment imports in particular from the development of export revenues, the Chinese leadership decided to conduct imports generally on a credit basis. The renunciation of the principle of not allowing private foreign enterprises to operate in Chinese territory had a similar goal. Direct <ref target="SIM-00016">foreign investment</ref> in the forms of <ref target="SIM-00113">joint ventures</ref>, foreign subsidiaries, mergers, acquisitions, and so forth were thus permitted. Transactions of this nature had an advantage over importing equipment and facilities on a cash or credit basis because in addition to the acquisition of technological knowledge and management know-how, access to foreign markets was facilitated. In this way, the import of equipment and facilities - which was to be expanded in order to assist in the transition from intensive to extensive growth - no longer possessed the buffering function which had effectively fallen to such imports in the past, at least during some phases of development. Instead, such imports became a strategic element of China's new growth and foreign trade strategies.</p>
            <p>As a result of this new policy, the volume of imports and exports changed drastically compared to previous decades, as did the commodity range and regional structure of foreign trade. Parallel to developments in economically successful neighboring countries that were integrated in the global market can easily be shown. In the period from 1981 to 1986, the foreign trade volume had a yearly growth rate of 13.5% (imports 12.9%, exports 14.2%). In absolute figures, the volume of foreign trade grew from about $38 billion in 1980 to about $290 billion in 1996: imports from about $20 billion to about $140 billion and exports from about $18 billion to about $151 billion. As a result, the share of imports and exports in the GDP increased distinctly, from a mere 5% each at the end of the 1970s to over 20% each in 1996. In this context, it is worth noting that in the second half of the 1990s nearly half of all foreign trade transactions were undertaken by enterprises which were either partially or completely in the possession of foreign investors. China's growing integration into the world market is expressed by the growing share of Chinese foreign trade in the global market. This share increased, for example, from 0.8% to 2% between 1978 and 1992. Statistical tests show that important domestic economic price ratios have since adjusted to global market price ratios. Nonetheless, the size of the country and the fact that the markets in some regions are not yet sufficiently developed still cause a plentitude of China-specific price ratios.</p>
            <p>China's willingness to accept foreign debt was initially expressed in negative foreign trade balances. Later, however, China exhibited not insignificant surpluses, which led to a quick increase in its foreign exchange reserves (<ref target="SIM-00274">balance of payments</ref>). It would be incorrect, however, to assume that this tendency of decreasing credit-financed imports indicates a reduction in the import of equipment and machines. Between 1993 and 1995 alone, China attracted nearly $100 billion worth of equipment, machines, and technology in the form of direct foreign investment.</p>
            <p>Changes in the commodity structure of China's foreign trade demonstrate its growing weight as a modern global economic partner. While the export-share of primary goods in 1980 was still 50% (of which foodstuffs alone accounted for 17% and petroleum and other products 24%), by 1995 it had fallen to 14%. The export-share of industrial products, by contrast, increased dramatically, from 50% in 1980 to 86% in 1995, which demonstrates China's growing competitiveness in high-order industrial products. Of significant importance here is the fact that among exported industrial goods the proportion of machines and means of transportation rose from 5% to 21%. Among imports the share of industrial good increased from 65% to 82% between 1980 and 1995; machines and equipment alone showed an increase from 26% to 40%. By contrast, the proportion of primary goods imported during the same period fell from 35% to 19%.</p>
            <p>The intention to regionally diversify foreign trade was extensively realized. China's most important foreign trade partners in 1997 were Japan, Hong Kong, the USA, and the EU. A regional breakdown of exports produces the following figures: Hong Kong 24%, Japan 17%, USA 18%, and EU 16%. In the same year, China obtained 20% of its imports from Japan, 11% from the USA, 18% from the EU, and 5% from Hong Kong. The development of bilateral trade between China and Taiwan is also noteworthy. In 1980 there had been effectively no trade relationship between the two. In 1997, by contrast, China exported 2% of its wares to Taiwan and Taiwanese good accounted for 11.5% of China's total imports (<ref target="COM-00008">foreign trade: Taiwan</ref>). In addition to the increasing regional diversification of Chinese foreign trade, the trend of growing integration of the Chinese economy into the Asian region deserves note. In 1980, China conducted 50% of its foreign trade with neighboring countries, particularly Japan and South Korea. By 1995 this figure had grown to 62%. The accumulation of intraregional trade can be seen as an indication that after the removal of barriers to foreign trade - initially imposed from outside and later self-imposed - the same basic structures began to reemerge which had historically characterized trade in the Asian region.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the 21st century, many of the tendencies noted above continued. The foreign trade volume reached $510 billion in 2001 and climbed to $1422 trillion in 2005. In the same period, imports grew from $244 billion to $660 billion and exports from $266 billion to $762 billion. Owing to the export surplus and other speculative capital inflow, China's foreign currency reserves increased drastically and thus widened the scope of political action regarding its exchange rate policy. In 2005, the share of foreign trade in GDP reached more than 50%, highly unusual for an economy the size of China.</p>
            <p>Just like in the past decade, FDI constituted an important driving force of both foreign trade and economic growth. FDI grew from $47 billion in 2001 to $60 billion in 2005. A major part of Chinese exports is still owed to foreign direct investment in modern branches of production. This could be the reason why in 2005 the share of machines and transport equipment in exports climbed to 46%, while the share of products from the primary sector declined to mere 6%. Small changes are to be noted with regard to regional foreign trade, yet there are now fundamental differences from the situation that emerged in the mid-1990s. The same applies to China's economic integration in Asia.</p>

         <p>Ulnage (the preferred term in The National Archives) means 'measurement', but in England the word came to be associated with a subsidy levied on high quality <ref target="SIM-000975">woollen</ref> cloths. In addition many towns appointed their own ulnagers whose duties were to measure lengths of cloth for sale. The only other country to levy a tax on cloth in medieval Europe was Catalonia, where it was known as <hi rendition="#italic">bolla</hi>.</p>
         <p>The king appointed ulnagers, whose duties included buying cloths for his household. There were long-running disputes about the sizes of cloth, and standards were laid down in the Statute of Northampton, 1328. Originally this statute applied to imported cloths but it was extended in 1350 to cover all cloth for sale. The king's ulnagers were so zealous that the number of cloths seized adversely affected trade. In 1353 a compromise was reached and the merchants agreed to pay a levy on each cloth.</p>
         <p>There were two parts to the charges, known colloquially as 'the ulnage'. The first was a subsidy of 4d per cloth of assize, worth 13s 4d or more with <hi rendition="#italic">pro rata</hi> payments on larger or smaller cloths, and 6d on <ref target="COM-550">scarlets</ref>. The revenue went to the Exchequer. In addition there was an ulnage fee of ½d per cloth, or ¼d for half cloths, paid to the ulnager. <ref target="COM-697">Worsted</ref> cloths were always excluded.</p>
         <p>There was a major re-structuring of the administration of the ulnage in 1394. The records from 1394 to 1485 are the most comprehensive, although the revenue was always small. The ulnage lasted until the tax was abolished in 1724. When a merchant paid the tax, a lead <ref target="COM-555">seal</ref> would be affixed in evidence. Some of these seals have survived and are to be found in museums.</p>
         <p>The tax was sometimes administered by ulnagers directly employed by the exchequer and sometimes by 'farmers' (who paid an annual fee and kept all the receipts: see <ref target="COM-119">alnagers</ref>), but the use of deputies was explicitly not allowed. The directly-employed ulnagers were expected to account in detail for the cloths that they had taxed, whereas the farmers had only to account for their farm fee. Both groups had the power to seize untaxed cloths offered for sale and they had to account for these. The returns describe such cloths and give their value. Seized cloths were valued locally and auctioned.</p>
         <p>Nearly all the surviving records are stored in The National Archives (TNA). Most of the appointments of ulnagers are recorded in the Fine Rolls. There are two Ulnage Rolls on which the returns of ulnagers are inscribed. In addition TNA holds a substantial number of particular records. Those of the directly-employed ulnagers of the 1390s, early 1400s and some from the 1460s are reasonably reliable and show who was paying the ulnage. There is a later series from the 1460s and 1470s which is clearly fictitious in part, if not in whole.</p>
         <p>The revenue, like most other royal income of the time, was usually allocated in advance and often the ulnagers were authorised to pay it directly to the designated recipients, thereby avoiding the risk and expense of sending it to London. The use of the tax can be ascertained from items in the Patent Rolls and Close Rolls. These include the upkeep of the walls of the city of Winchester, and the maintenance of the king's hunting dogs.</p>
